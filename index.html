        <p class="lead ">The history of coffee dates back to the 15th century, and possibly earlier with a number of
          reports and legends surrounding its first use. The native (undomesticated) origin of Coffee bean is thought to
          have been Ethiopia. The earliest substantiated evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee
          tree is from the early 15th century, in the Sufi monasteries of Yemen,spreading soon to Mecca and Cairo. By
          the 16th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East, South India (Karnataka), Persia, Turkey, the
          Horn of Africa, and northern Africa. Coffee then spread to the Balkans, Italy, and to the rest of Europe, as
          well as Southeast Asia and then to America, despite bans imposed during the 15th century by religious leaders
          in Mecca and Cairo, and later by the Catholic Church.</p>

            <p class="car-text">Coffea canephora, commonly known as robusta coffee, is a species of coffee that has its
              origins in central and western sub-Saharan Africa. It is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae
              family. Though widely known as Coffea robusta, the plant is scientifically identified as Coffea canephora,
              which has two main varieties, robusta and nganda.<br> The plant has a shallow root system and grows as a
              robust tree or shrub to about 10 metres. It flowers irregularly, taking about 10â€“11 months for cherries to
              ripen, producing oval-shaped beans. The robusta plant has a greater crop yield than Caffea arabica, and
              contains more caffeine â€“ 2.7% compared to arabica's 1.5%. As it is less susceptible to pests and disease,
              robusta needs much less herbicide and pesticide than arabica</p>

            <p class="car-text">Roasting brings out the aroma and flavor that is locked inside the green coffee beans.
              Beans are stored green, a state in which they can be kept without loss of quality or taste. A green bean
              has none of the characteristics of a roasted bean itâ€™s soft and spongy to the bite and smells grassy. <br>
              Roasting causes chemical changes to take place as the beans are rapidly brought to very high
              temperatures.<br> When they reach the peak of perfection, they are quickly cooled to stop the process.
              Roasted beans smell like coffee, and weigh less because the moisture has been roasted out. They are
              crunchy to the bite, ready to be ground and brewed.<br>Once roasted, however, they should be used as
              quickly as possible before the fresh roast flavor begins to diminish.</p>

        <p class="lead ">Why people drink coffee are more than simply the caffeine content. While this
          would be the most obvious answer and the one that most people would think is the top reason, it is not the
          only reason. A steaming cup of coffee is the first thing millions of people reach for every morning and there
          are a multitude of reasons these people do so on a daily basis. Some of those reasons and why they are the top
          reasons are included here.Caffeine is the ingredient that most people who drink coffee indulge in their
          favorite beverage. The caffeine in it plays two roles in why people drink coffee. First, the caffeine in
          coffee helps to get people' blood moving and makes them feel energized. Third shift workers and early morning
          workers tend to rely on their coffee to help them get through their work day</p>

        <h2 class="display-4">Reasons Why People Drink Coffee</h2>
        <h3>Several Health Benefits</h3>
        <p>
          Many of the nutrients in coffee beans make their way into the finished brewed drink. Packed with antioxidants
          and vitamins such as riboflavin, magnesium, and potassium, coffee can help to lessen depression, promote a
          healthy heart, and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, Alzheimerâ€™s disease,
          liver disease, and liver cancer.</p>
        <p>
          Since coffee contains caffeine, this popular beverage can help people feel less tired, increase energy levels,
          burn fat by jump-starting the bodyâ€™s metabolism, and improve productivity and brain functionâ€”including memory,
          mood, reaction times, and general mental function.</p>
        <p>
          Although there are many healthful benefits of coffee, consuming it in moderation is still important to avoid
          side effects, as well as limiting the amount of less-nutritious ingredients like cream and sugar you add to
          each cup of joe.
        </p>
        <h3>Can Be a Comforting Routine</h3>
        <p>For many people, coffee is the first beverage consumed in the morning and can be relied upon for energy to
          help
          them get through the day. For some, the smell and taste of coffee are comforting. If you are deprived of
          sleep,
          having a cup of your favorite brew can help you feel more relaxed and ready to be productive.</p>

        <h3>Fosters Social Interaction</h3>
        <p>Similar to social alcohol drinking at a bar, people enjoy gathering at coffee shops to meet with friends or
          to conduct a business meeting. Many coffee shops promote a relaxing environment with inviting dÃ©cor, music
          performances, and more.</p>

        <h5>Expresso</h5>
        <p>An espresso is a strong black coffee made from steam. The name espresso is Italian for pressed out coffee.
          While an espresso is a type of beverage made from coffee beans, it is completely different than what most
          people consider to be regular coffee.</p>
        <h5>Cappuccino</h5>
        <p>Now days, cappuccino is quick and simple to prepare with the help of certain espresso maker. Preparation of
          Cappuccino involves espresso shot which is later been added with steamed milk and milk foam with chocolate and
          cinnamon sprinkled on top of it.</p>
        <h5>Turkish</h5>
        <p>Turkish coffee is made unfiltered with finely ground coffee beans (so fine that they resemble the texture of
          cocoa powder). The ground beans are boiled with sugar and cardamom in a special pot called a cezve or ibrik
        </p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-2 type-of-cofe">
        <h5>Americano</h5>
        <p>An americano is a espresso drink that is prepared by brewing a shot of espresso, and then diluting it with
          twice the amount of water. The strength of the americano depends on the number of shots of espresso, and then
          the amount of water added</p>
        <h5>Red eye</h5>
        <p>Red eye is basically for those people who are over with espresso and find no strength in drip coffee. So in
          order to attain the strength, the stronger coffee is discovered just by mixing shot of espresso in dark
          roasted drip coffee brew with drip coffee maker.</p>
        <h5>Yuan Yang</h5>
        <p> This drink is proper and unique combination of Coffee and Hong Kong special milk tea, which earlier was only
          being served by the street vendors but is now available in most of the cafÃ©.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-2 type-of-cofe">
        <h5>Iced coffee</h5>
        <p>Iced coffee is a type of coffee beverage served chilled, being cold brew â€“ brewing the coffee cold, yielding
          a different flavour, generally by simply pouring over ice or into ice cold milk.</p>
        <h5>Latte macchiato</h5>
        <p>Latte Macchiato is a drink which is prepared by frothing milk to obtain perfect temperature and foam. Then
          half a cup of espresso is added on to it in your latte glass. This brings up three layers, one of milk,
          another of espresso and with the top of the foam.</p>
        <h5>CafÃ© frappe</h5>
        <p>CafÃ© Frappe is actually instant cold coffee which is prepared using instant coffee as it has no oil.</p>
        <h5>Irish coffee</h5>

          using hot dark brewed coffee, mixing with Irish whiskey and sugar</p>
